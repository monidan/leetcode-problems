# Leetcode problems, algorithms & data structures

In this repo I do tracking of all of data structures, algorithms and leetcode problems I have had experience with.

Most of the files have testing coverage. All of the info about algorithms were studied from Wikipidia, Grocking Algorithms and different articles (like Medium and so on)

Technologies used:
- JavaScript, as a language to write all of the code;
- Mocha, as a testing framework;
